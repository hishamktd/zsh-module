### Commit Workflow

#### `commit [message] [flags]`

commit "feat: add new feature"                    # Simple commit
commit "fix: resolve bug" --no-verify            # Skip hooks
commit                                            # Interactive commit

# With scope
commit "feat(auth): add login functionality"
```

branch -ls -a                # List all branches

# Create and switch
branch feature/new-feature    # Create and switch to new branch
branch -c feature/auth        # Create branch from current
