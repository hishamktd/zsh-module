# Git Module - Enhanced Git Workflow Commands (matching PowerShell script functions)
# 
# This file is a placeholder - all git functions are now organized in separate files:
# - status.zsh, commit.zsh, branch.zsh, push.zsh, pull.zsh, log.zsh
# - stash.zsh, undo.zsh, clean.zsh, find.zsh, blame.zsh, stats.zsh 
# - working.zsh, swap.zsh, aliases.zsh
#
# The build script will automatically include all these files
